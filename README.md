# **valentines-web** ðŸ’Œ  

Hi Liam,  
I'm sure you've seen something like this online before, but I wanted to make my own just for you!!  

Unfortunately, I've been struggling to deploy this. I *think* I know what the issue is, but fixing it has been a bit of a headache. Since it's already February, I need to ask you something important!!  

## **How to Run This Locally**  

Follow these steps to see what I made for you:  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
Open your terminal and navigate to a folder where youâ€™d like to save this project. Then, run:  

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

### **2. Navigate to the Project Folder**  
Move into the project directory:  

```bash
cd valentines-web
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**  
You'll need `pnpm` to manage packages. If you donâ€™t have it installed, run:  

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then, install the project dependencies:  

```bash
pnpm i
```

### **4. Start the Development Server**  
Run the following command to start the project:  

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### **5. View the Site**  
After running the command above, a local website should open in your browser. Click on it and see what I made for you! ðŸ’–

Hopefully, this works!! AHHHHH ðŸŽ‰ Let me know if you run into any issues. ðŸ˜…
